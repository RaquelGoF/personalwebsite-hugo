abstract: "Microsilica particles arise as a byproduct of silicon furnace
  operation, created inside high temperature flames due to the combustion
  reaction of silicon monoxide with oxygen. These nanoparticles, which grow as
  silicon dioxide vapor condenses on the surface of existing particles, are used
  in a variety of composite materials. The size and quality of the particles
  affect the performance of the material used for such applications, and hence
  control of these quantities is of importance to manufacturers. Motivated by
  this, we derive a mathematical model that connects local thermal and chemical
  concentrations conditions to the formation and growth of microsilica
  particles. We consider two distinct reductions of our general model: the case
  of initially well-mixed or spatially homogeneous chemical species (modeling
  the region within the flame or reaction zone), and the case of initially
  spatially separated chemical species, in which diffusion will play a dominant
  role in providing material to a combustion front (modeling a larger cross
  section, which contains a reaction zone with limiting quantities of fuel which
  must diffuse into the reaction zone). In both cases, we provide asymptotic
  solutions for the temperature, chemical concentrations, and number density
  function of microsilica particles in the oxygen rich limit, and compare them
  to numerical simulations. Motivated by realistic furnace control mechanisms,
  we treat the relative quantity of oxygen to other fuel components and the
  saturation concentration of silicon dioxide as control parameters, discussing
  how each may be used to modify the properties (such as size and abundance) of
  microsilica particles formed. One physically interesting finding is the
  theoretical description of a bimodal distribution for microsilica particle
  size which was previously observed in experiments."
