abstract: In our attempts to emulate natural flood risk management, we should
  also pause to learn from nature about system performance, such as beaver-dam
  failures, cascade failure leading to very high flood peaks, or for example
  downstream asset blockage from woody debris. This is not to detract from the
  obvious merits and multiple benefits of NFM, but to try and better appreciate
  the risks. One approach has been to develop simple 1d and 2d hydraulic models
  with fragility assumptions about modelled leaky barriers and explore
  utilisation of dynamic storage, flood peak synchronisation (Metcalfe et al,
  2017), resilience in the face of different spatial extreme rainfall (Hankin et
  al., 2016) and occurrence of failure. In this paper we explore whether there
  are better spatial configurations of leaky barriers (main stem or headwater)
  taking into account of effectiveness to reduce flooding and the possibility of
  failure and cascade failure using an ensemble of simulations. The work was
  undertaken at a Maths Foresees "Environmental Modelling in Industry Study
  Group", based on a challenge set by the JBA Trust in April, 2017. A team of
  mathematicians developed a network-based model of a catchment basin that
  incorporates the possibility of small-scale runoff attenuation features
  (`leaky dams') being incorporated into each of the edges of the network. The
  model is forced by a prescribed runoff to each node and predicts the time
  series of discharge through-out the network. It can be used to analyse the
  benefit and risk associated with adding dams at specific network locations. We
  demonstrate the model using idealised one-dimensional and two-dimensional
  networks, and explore the risk of cascade failure. We discuss the formulation
  of an optimisation problem to decide on the best dam placements for a given
  catchment, and give suggestions for future directions.
