abstract: Smart Separations Limited (SSL) is a UK-based start-up who have
  developed a ceramic membrane with micron-sized conical pores distinct to the
  cylindrical pores typically used for filtration. This new technology has the
  potential to be highly beneficial to many applications. However to realize its
  potential, a comprehensive analysis of the performance and efficiency of the
  membrane is vital. We use mathematical modelling to explore and quantify the
  behaviour and performance of the membrane and its link to the underlying pore
  structure. We derive a reduced model based on the slenderness of the membrane
  pores that allows us to predict the flux through the membrane, the optimal
  pore shape that maximizes the amount of contaminant that is trapped. A full 2D
  numerical framework allows us to study the flow structure within the pores and
  the effect of changing the angle of the flow of contaminants as it reaches the
  membrane. Finally, a probabilistic model based on expectation values provides
  an analytic prediction for the flux decline with time due to membrane
  blocking. The outcomes of this work provide a first step to providing the key
  modelling insight that will allow SSL to take this new technology to market.
