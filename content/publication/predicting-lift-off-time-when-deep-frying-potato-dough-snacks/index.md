abstract: When frying potato snacks, it is typically observed that the dough,
  which is submerged in hot oil, after some critical time increases its buoyancy
  and floats to the surface. The lift-off time is a useful metric in ensuring
  that the snacks are properly cooked. Here we propose a multiphase mathematical
  model for the frying of potato snacks, where water inside the dough is
  evaporated from both the top and bottom surfaces of the snack at two receding
  evaporation fronts. The vapor created at the top of the snack bubbles away to
  the surface, whereas the vapor released from the bottom surface forms a
  buoyant blanket layer. By asymptotic analysis, we show that the model
  simplifies to solving a one-dimensional Stefan problem in the snack coupled to
  a thin-film equation in the vapor blanket through a nonlinear boundary
  condition. Using our mathematical model, we predict the change in the snack
  density as a function of time and investigate how lift-off time depends on the
  different parameters of the problem.
