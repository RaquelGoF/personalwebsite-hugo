This project corresponds to my BSc dissertation at the University of La Laguna (Department of Mathematical Analysis).

## Abstract
The present work is mainly divided into two parts. In the first we deal in great detail with the Riesz’s representation Theorem and certain properties enjoyed by positive Borel measures. The latter theorem asserts the existence of a measure representing a given positive linear functional defined in the space of compactly supported functions on locally compact Hausdorff spaces via integration. This allows us to present a non constructive proof of the existence of Lebesgue measure.

In the second we focus on Fourier Analysis. First we introduce the Lebesgue spaces $L_1(R)$ and $L_2(R)$ and the Schwartz space $S(R)$. After introducing the convolution and studying its main properties we give the inversion Theorem for the Fourier transform as well as Plancherel’s Theorem. Moreover, we analyze the behavior of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space highlighting the fact that it is a bijection on it.
We conclude the dissertation by giving some applications of the Fourier transform to Physics: the solution to the heat equation and a mathematical formulation of Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

**Keywords**: Borel measure, Riesz’s Theorem, Linear functional, Fourier transform, Lebesgue measure, $L_p$ spaces, Schwartz space.
