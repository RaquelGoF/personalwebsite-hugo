Several techniques exist to measure the thickness of ocular structures, such as histology, ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and confocal microscopy. Lein Applied Diagnostics have developed a low-cost and non-invasive device to measure the thickness of the central cornea, that is, of the difference in distance
between the epithelium (or anterior cornea) and endothelium (or posterior cornea) surfaces from a reference point located at the optical axis.
An accurate measurement of the central corneal thickness is vital for the diagnosis of glaucoma, a leading cause of vision loss. 

The non-contact system developed by Lein is based on a confocal focus-detection scheme. The measurements are obtained by looking at the intensity peaks obtained from light reflected by the eye. However, the signal reflected by the posterior cornea is very weak, and thus the posterior peak is much more difficult to detect. Moreover, the signal is usually corrupted by random noise that may be due to imperfections in the optical system, movement of the eye during the test, or presence of microstructures within the cornea. The aim of this project was to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the thickness measurements by enhancing the
quality of the signal first, proposing a new peak detection algorithm and analysing the use of different statistics or estimates of the thickness.
