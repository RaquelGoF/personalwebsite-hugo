In the final year of my BSc in Mathematics I undertook a research internship at the [Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC)](https://www.iac.es/en/about-us). The research project focused on characterising images of dense stellar fields. The work consisted on generating a large number of synthetic images simulating dense stellar fields, where the magnitude of the different stars is known. These simulations then allowed to characterise the dependence of the magnitude of the stars, as measured by an IAC internal software, on different observational effects. 

The project was in collaboration with the [Stellar Populations Group](https://www.iac.es/en/projects/stellar-populations-galaxies) at the IAC.
