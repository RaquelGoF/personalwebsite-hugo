    description: 'I worked as part of a team on developing comprehensive mathematical models of the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in indoor spaces. Our modelling framework involves numerical and analytical solutions of advection-diffusion equations and CFD simulations to accurately model air flows and transport of SARS-CoV-2. In collaboration with the company Smart Separations Ltd. and funded by the Welsh Government.
