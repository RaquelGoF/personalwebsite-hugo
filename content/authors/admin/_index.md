I am an applied mathematician specialising in mathematical modelling of industrial and real-world problems arising in biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering. 

I grew up in the Canary Islands (Spain), where I received my bachelors in Mathematics before moving to the UK to learn more advanced mathematical topics. I graduated with a distinction from the University of Bath in MSc ‘Modern Applications of Mathematics’, which allowed me to write a dissertation in collaboration with the company Schlumberger. The success of this work motivated me to pursue a PhD in Applied Mathematics as part of the Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling Centre for Doctoral Training (InFoMM CDT) at the University of Oxford. My PhD research focused on the mathematical modelling of the formation and growth of microsilica particles resulting from a combustion reaction inside silicon furnaces in collaboration with the company Elkem. More recently, I worked on developing models for the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in indoor spaces as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Cardiff University. The project was funded by the Welsh Government, which has used our team's results to inform policies related to the pandemic. Further multidisciplinary projects and industry engagements have been possible through my continuous attendance to industry study groups worldwide. 

Outside of academia, my interests include yoga, rock climbing, and music (piano, guitar, ukelele, singing). Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaboration or for a more informal discussion.
